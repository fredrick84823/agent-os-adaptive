## 2025-08-06: Initial Product Analysis and Agent OS Installation

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Install Agent OS into the existing ADK Data Science Multi-Agent System to enable structured development workflow and documentation. The product focuses on democratizing data science capabilities for analysts and business users through natural language interactions with BigQuery and machine learning systems.

### Context

The codebase represents a mature multi-agent system built on Google's ADK framework with comprehensive BigQuery integration, data visualization, and BQML capabilities. The system already has extensive functionality including multi-project support, CSV export, comprehensive testing, and deployment capabilities. Agent OS installation will provide structured development processes for future enhancements, particularly the planned Cloud Run deployment.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Continue without structured documentation**
   - Pros: No overhead, maintain current development velocity
   - Cons: Lack of systematic approach for future features, no clear roadmap visibility, difficult onboarding for new team members

2. **Use alternative project management system**
   - Pros: Established tools, team familiarity
   - Cons: Not designed for AI-assisted development, lacks code-aware task management, requires separate documentation maintenance

### Rationale

Agent OS provides AI-native development workflows that align with the project's sophisticated multi-agent architecture. The system's existing complexity and planned Cloud Run deployment benefit from structured spec planning and task execution frameworks.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Systematic approach to Cloud Run deployment and future enhancements
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions and technical stack
- Structured task management for complex multi-agent system changes
- Better team collaboration through documented specs and roadmaps

**Negative:**
- Initial overhead in learning Agent OS workflows
- Need to maintain additional documentation files

## 2025-08-06: Multi-Agent Architecture Pattern

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Technical Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Maintain the existing multi-agent orchestration pattern with specialized sub-agents (Database, Analytics, BQML) coordinated by a root agent. This architecture has proven effective for complex data science workflows.

### Context

The current system uses a sophisticated multi-agent pattern where:
- Root agent handles task delegation and orchestration
- Database agent specializes in BigQuery operations and NL2SQL
- Analytics agent focuses on data visualization and Python-based analysis
- BQML agent provides machine learning capabilities with RAG enhancement

Based on the existing node classification analysis, this creates a clear separation between core orchestration nodes, business logic nodes, and leaf feature nodes.

### Rationale

The multi-agent pattern effectively handles the complexity of data science workflows while maintaining clear separation of concerns. Each agent can be optimized for its specific domain, and the architecture supports incremental enhancement without affecting other agents.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear separation of concerns and maintainability
- Specialized optimization for each domain (SQL, Python, ML)
- Flexible task delegation based on query complexity
- Proven architecture pattern in production

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in agent coordination
- Potential latency from agent delegation
- More complex debugging and error handling

## 2025-08-06: Cloud Run Migration Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Technical Lead, DevOps Team

### Decision

Migrate deployment from Vertex AI Agent Engine to Google Cloud Run for improved scalability, cost efficiency, and deployment flexibility while maintaining all existing functionality.

### Context

Current deployment uses Vertex AI Agent Engine, which provides managed AI agent hosting but may have limitations in terms of cost optimization and deployment customization. Cloud Run offers serverless container deployment with auto-scaling capabilities and potentially better cost control for variable workloads.

### Rationale

Cloud Run provides:
- Better cost control through pay-per-request pricing
- More flexible deployment options and container customization
- Auto-scaling capabilities for variable workloads
- Integration with existing GCP infrastructure
- Potential performance improvements through optimized container runtime

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Improved cost efficiency for variable usage patterns
- Enhanced deployment flexibility and customization options
- Better integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Improved monitoring and observability capabilities

**Negative:**
- Migration effort required for containerization
- Need to implement health checks and monitoring
- Potential changes to authentication and request handling
- Learning curve for Cloud Run-specific configurations

## 2025-08-06: Development Approach by Component Classification

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, Technical Lead

### Decision

Use the existing dependency-based node classification system to guide development approaches:
- Core Nodes (agent orchestration, BigQuery tools): Careful oversight with comprehensive testing
- Business Logic Nodes (agent coordination, query processing): Standard TDD approach
- Leaf Nodes (export features, utilities): Autonomous development with E2E focus

### Context

The project already has comprehensive node classification analysis identifying component dependencies and risk levels. This analysis provides a data-driven approach to determine appropriate development strategies for different parts of the system.

### Rationale

Different system components require different development approaches based on their dependency impact. Core infrastructure components need careful testing and review, while standalone features can be developed more rapidly with minimal risk.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Optimized development velocity based on risk assessment
- Reduced bottlenecks for low-risk feature development
- Maintained quality for critical system components
- Data-driven development process decisions

**Negative:**
- Need to maintain component classification accuracy
- Potential for misclassification leading to inappropriate development approach
- Additional complexity in development process planning
