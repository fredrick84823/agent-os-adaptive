## Overview

Implement a query history dashboard that shows users their recent BigQuery queries with basic analytics like execution time, result size, and success rate. This feature will help analysts track their query patterns and improve their data exploration workflow efficiency.

## User Stories

### Query History View

As a data analyst, I want to see my recent queries, so that I can track what I've been working on and easily re-run successful queries.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User asks "show me my query history" or "what queries have I run recently?"
2. System displays last 20 queries with timestamp, query text (truncated), status, and execution time
3. User can ask for more details about any specific query
4. User can ask to re-run a previous query

### Query Analytics Dashboard

As a business user, I want to see analytics about my query usage, so that I can understand my data exploration patterns and identify opportunities for improvement.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User requests "show me my query analytics" or "query statistics"
2. System displays summary metrics: total queries, success rate, average execution time, most queried tables
3. System shows simple visualizations (bar charts) of query patterns over time
4. User gains insights into their data exploration habits

## Spec Scope

1. **Query History Logging** - Track and store user queries with metadata (timestamp, execution time, status, result count)
2. **History Display** - Show recent queries in conversational format with key details
3. **Query Analytics** - Generate basic statistics and visualizations about query patterns
4. **Query Re-execution** - Allow users to easily re-run previous queries
5. **Session-based Storage** - Store query history within the current session context

## Out of Scope

- Persistent storage across sessions (queries only stored during current conversation)
- Query optimization recommendations
- Sharing query history between users
- Advanced analytics beyond basic metrics
- Query result caching or storage

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can ask "show my query history" and see their last 20 queries with status and timing
2. Users can request "query analytics" and see success rate, execution patterns, and simple visualizations
3. Users can say "re-run query #3" to execute a previous query again
