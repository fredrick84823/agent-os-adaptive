# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-06-query-history-dashboard/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-06
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**QueryHistoryTracker**
- Test query logging with various metadata combinations
- Test session storage limits and cleanup
- Test query truncation for long SQL statements
- Test timestamp and execution time recording

**QueryHistoryFormatter**  
- Test conversational response formatting
- Test analytics calculations (success rate, average time)
- Test query re-execution command parsing
- Test empty history edge cases

### Integration Tests

**Agent Integration**
- Test history logging during actual BigQuery operations
- Test history display through conversational interface
- Test query analytics generation with real session data
- Test query re-execution workflow end-to-end

**Session State Integration**
- Test persistence of query history across multiple interactions
- Test session cleanup when limits exceeded
- Test concurrent user sessions (if applicable)

### E2E Tests

**Query History Workflow**
- User runs several queries → requests history → sees formatted list
- User requests analytics → sees success rate and timing charts
- User asks to re-run specific query → query executes successfully

**Error Handling**
- Invalid query re-execution requests return helpful messages
- Empty query history displays appropriate message
- Analytics with insufficient data shows meaningful response

### Mocking Requirements

- **BigQuery Client:** Mock query execution and results for predictable test data
- **ADK Session State:** Mock session storage for isolated testing
- **Plotly Visualization:** Mock chart generation to test data preparation without rendering
