## Overview

<purpose>
  - To conduct a comprehensive, one-time analysis of the entire project's codebase.
  - To generate a dependency map and a node classification document that will serve as a baseline for all future feature development.
  - This process categorizes code components into "Core Nodes," "Business Logic Nodes," and "Leaf Nodes" to inform development strategies.
</purpose>

<context>
  - This is a foundational step, typically run once during the initial setup of Agent OS on a project via `analyze-product.md`.
  - It can be re-run if the core architecture undergoes significant changes.
  - The output is stored in `.agent-os/architecture-analysis/` and used by `create-spec.md` to assess the impact of new features.
</context>

<prerequisites>
  - An existing codebase to analyze.
  - Write access to the project root to create the `.agent-os/architecture-analysis/` directory and its contents.
</prerequisites>

  ## âœ… Codebase Architecture Analysis Complete

  I have successfully analyzed the entire codebase and generated the following architecture documents:

  - **Dependency Map:** @.agent-os/architecture-analysis/dependency_map.mermaid
  - **Node Classification:** @.agent-os/architecture-analysis/node_classification.md

  These files provide a foundational understanding of the project's structure and will be used to guide future development.
